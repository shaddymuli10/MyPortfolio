    <h2>About Me </h2>
    <div class="singledetail">
        

        <p>Hello there! I'm Shadrack Malombe, a passionate and creative web designer, mobile app developer, and graphics designer. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Applied Computer Science at Chuka University, with an expected completion by the end of this year (2019-2023). I'm also excited to earn a Certificate in Web Development from KCA University by this September.

            My journey in the world of design and technology began with a spark of curiosity, and since then, I've been on a quest to master my craft and create exceptional experiences for users. I thrive on turning ideas into reality and take pride in crafting innovative and engaging solutions that leave a lasting impact.
            
            As I progress in my academic journey, I've had the pleasure of working on various projects that have enriched my experience and honed my skills in web design, mobile app development, and graphics design. I understand the importance of user-centric design and strive to deliver experiences that not only look great but also function flawlessly.
            
            What sets me apart is my commitment to excellence and my adaptability to new technologies. I'm always eager to learn and stay updated with the latest trends and industry best practices. Collaboration is at the heart of my approach, and I enjoy working with clients and teams who share the same passion for innovation and creativity.
            
            As I look forward to the future, my vision is to establish myself as a leader in the tech industry. I'm determined to make a positive impact through my work and contribute to meaningful projects. I'm currently working towards launching my venture, Bidiitu Software Developers, where I aspire to be the CEO and lead a team of talented professionals.
            
            I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and the opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals and organizations. Let's embark on a journey of creating remarkable experiences together.
            
            Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!</p>
